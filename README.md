# week-3-assignment.py
my assignment week 3
I have created a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function takes the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, it applies the discount; otherwise, returns the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, I have primped the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. It then prints the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount applied, it  prints the original price.
